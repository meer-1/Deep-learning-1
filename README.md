In this project, we build a Convolutional Neural Network using the pytorch python library. The neural
network takes an image of 28*28 pixels and predicts its label. Experiment 1 is 10 class classification
problem and experiment 2 is 4 class classification problem, some classes are merged in the 2nd experiment.
